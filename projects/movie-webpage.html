            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <p>I used all the HTML and CSS I learned from class and FreeCodeCamp to create a fictional movie webpage.</p>
            <p>Me and My partner Roxette created a movie Webpage about a horror film. We had no idea what film to base it on, so we just made up the story and a bunch of characters. It didn't make much sense but the important part was the code, so it didn't matter that much. I worked on the CSS while my partner worked on the html. </p>
            <p>One issue i had was with the selectors, specifically using ids. For some reason, <code>&lt;img id="id"="#"&gt;</code> didn't work. I ended up assigning it a class id instead.  There were two more challenges. The first was coming up with the plot and story. Although we were being graded on the code, neither of us could think of anything to base our code on. We ended up creating characters and story as broad as it could be. Another issue we had were the images since we could only use images that had the creative commons license. We ended up creating one and getting a stick figure from google that had the license. Two takeaways i had doing this projects are to use an alternative method if something doesn't work and try and be more creative.</p>
